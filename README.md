# Hello, 

The idea of this app is to stay focused when programming and stay problem-solving orientated or don't spam you with a useless message when you send some link to your family member or friend and write:  "ignore, this it's for me. I don't want to lose, I plan to watch it later..."



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# How to use it?

Simple: copy the URL of the article, or video, and paste it into "Content", then fill type as you want: "youtube video" or "Read", then add some note. What you found there interesting, or what problem your content solves. e.g. "Interesting approach for styled components."
